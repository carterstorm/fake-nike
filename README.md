# Fake nike website - main page

A fully responsive main page of a well-known online store of Nike company. This is one of my first projects that I wrote on my own, based on an existing website. At the very beginning, I wanted to store application states in Redux, but I decide to use custom hooks. I tried to use as many reusable components as it is possible. Data is displayed from local files.The images come from Nike servers. For loading element I used skeleton animation. The website is written only in Polish language :(

In the future, when I become more knowledgeable, I would like to create a full copy of this website.

## Used technologies:

- create-react-app
- webpack
- Normalize.css
- Styled Components
- JSX
- JS ES6+
- React
- React Router
- React Redux
- Redux Toolkit

## Here are the app views for different devices:

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
